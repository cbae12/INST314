## Questions to Answer
Consider the standard normal distribution:

### Part 1
1. what is the threshold for the bottom 9%? That is, what is the z-value, to the left of which, the area under the curve is 9%?

2. what is the threshold for the top 7%? That is, what is the z-value, to the right of which, the area under the curve is 7%?

3. what is the threshold for the middle 94% around the mean? That is, what is the z-value such that the area under the curve between -z and +z equals 94%?

4. what is the threshold for 8% on the two tails? That is, what is the z-value such that the area outside the region between -z and +z equals 8%?

5. what is the area under the curve to the left of z=1.7?

6. what is the area under the curve to the right of z=2.1?

7. what is the area to the left of z= -1.7?

8. what is the area outside the region between z= -1.3 and z= +1.3?

### Part 2
Now consider the t distribution with df=15:

9. what is the threshold for the bottom 9%? That is, what is the t-value, to the left of which, the area under the curve is 9%?

10. what is the threshold for the top 7%? That is, what is the t-value, to the right of which, the area under the curve is 7%?

11. what is the threshold for the middle 94% around the mean? That is, what is the t-value such that the area under the curve between -t and +t equals 94%?

12. what is the threshold for 8% on the two tails? That is, what is the t-value such that the area outside the region between -t and +t equals 8%?

13. what is the area under the curve to the left of t=1.7?

14. what is the area under the curve to the right of t=2.1?

15. what is the area to the left of t= -1.7?

16. what is the area outside the region between t=-1.3 and t=+1.3?

### Part 3
Now consider the t distribution with df=1500:

17. repeat question 9: what is the threshold for the bottom 9%? That is, what is the t-value, to the left of which, the area under the curve is 9%?

18. repeat question 14: what is the area under the curve to the right of t=2.1?

### Part 4
Consider the dataset of car accidents that you worked with in the previous homeworks.

19. what is the mean of the Temperature column?

### Part 4a
Now let's take the first 20 rows to be our sample.

20. what is the sample mean?

21. what is the 95% confidence interval for the mean?

22. what is the 99% confidence interval?

23. what is the 90% confidence interval?

### Part 4b
Now let's take the first 200 rows to be our sample.

24. what is the sample mean?

25. what is the 95% confidence interval?

## Submission Format
Upon submission, rename the answer sheet csv file as follows: hw3_idName.csv, where "idName" must be replaced with the id name that is used in the label of your dataset csv file. For example, mine is bfotouhi. Then upload the csv file and your R code.
