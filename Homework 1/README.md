## Homework Setup
- In this homework we use R to analyze a dataset about car accidents in the US. It contains some information about each car accident, including weather and road conditions.

- Please find your own dataset under Files in the folder corresponding to homework 1. you can also find the R codes of lectures also under Files if you want to practice more. You can use chunks of those codes to save time if you like, or you can write from scratch.

## Questions
1. Which are the top two counties that occur most frequently in your dataset?

2. In the state of Maryland, which two counties occur most frequently in the dataset?

3. Which are the top two states that occur most frequently in your dataset?

4. For each state, we can pool all its accidents and then calculate what fraction of them have severity=4. If we do this for every state, which are the top three states in terms of the proportion of severity=4 accidents?

5. Which are the bottom four states in terms of average temperature of accidents? ("bottom four states" means the four states with lowest average temperature)
