Now take the first 200 values of this column to be our sample.

3. what is the sample mean?

4. what is the sample median?

5. Use R's t.test function to obtain a 90% confidence interval for the mean temperature.

6. Use the bootstrap method with 10,000 resamples to obtain a 90% confidence interval for the mean temperature.

7. Use the bootstrap method with 10,000 resamples to obtain a 90% confidence interval for the median temperature.
