# Homework 2 Basic Summary Stats, Z-scores, & Distribution of Data
<hr/>

## Homework Setup
- Consider the dataset assigned to you in homework 1---the dataset of US car accidents.
<hr/>

## Questions to Answer
### Part 1
- Let's work on the "Temperature(F)" column:
1. What is the size of the dataset? (how many datapoints do we have?)

2. What is the mean of this column?

3. What is the standard deviation?

4. What is the maximum value?

5. What is the minimum value?

### Part 2
- Calculate the standard scores (also called z-scores) of this column and find:

6. What is the z-score of the largest value?

7. What is the z-score of the smallest value?

### Part 3
- Now we investigate the distribution:

8. How many data points are within one standard deviation away from the mean? (that is, how many datapoints are less than mean + sd and greater than mean - sd?

9. What proportion of the datapoints are within one standard deviation away from the mean?

10. What proportion of the datapoints are within two standard deviations away from the mean?

## Submission format:
- You must submit two files: The first file is your code, .R, in whatever style you like. No specific guideline.

- The second file must be either .txt or .csv (your choice), containing the answers. It must have 10 lines, because there are 10 questions. Each line is only a number, which is the answer to that question.

    * For example, suppose a student has a dataset of 1000 points, with answer to question one being 1000, answer to question two being, hypothetically, 60.03, answer to question three being 18.07, answer to question four being 106.5, and so on. The .txt file or .csv file that this student must submit looks like this:

    1000

    60.03

    18.07

    106.5

    and so on for next rows.

**Note**:
- ROUND ALL ANSWERS WITH DECIMAL POINTS TO TWO DIGITS AFTER THE DECIMAL POINTS.

- use the round() function in R to do so. For example, round(0.43342,2) gives 0.43, therefore 0.43 must be reported, not 0.43342.
